- Simon here
- I’m currently learning about software development and I have chosen Swwift(UI) for this as I heard it is beginner friendly.
- I am open to learning about deploying machine learning models in software (If you have any useful resources to tap into let me know)
- You can reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-matome if you have any pointers on any of my projects.
